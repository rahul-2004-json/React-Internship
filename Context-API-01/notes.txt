In this Tutorial we created a context folder
1.Created a UserContext file and created a gloabal variable UserContext inside it and exported it.

2.Then we created a UserContextprovider file in which childrens are passed as props to it. 
These childrens are nothing but components that we will be providing within UserContextProvider

3.We created a state inside the userContextProvider file and passed it in form of values in UserContextProvider

4.The above passed functions, variables inside the userContextProvider will be accessible in any component.

5.Then we imported the UserContextProvider inside the app file and wahtever component we will pass within it, 
will have access to every variable or functions made inside context

6.To use the data or function present in context inside any component we will simply call the hook useContext and get value or function from it.
